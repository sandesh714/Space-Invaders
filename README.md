# Retro Journey 1: Space Invaders

A simple implementation of a retro style video game where users compete against asteroids and the goal is to destroy as many asteroids as they can with a spaceship and score as many points as they can. Users can move upward and rotate and move in any direction. Users can shoot at the asteroids and destroy them.
